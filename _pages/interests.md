## Research Interests

I usually like to work at the intersection of theory and application, with an emphasis on the former. I am interested in the following areas:

<ul>
<li> Sequential Decision Making with a focus on Bandits and Online Learning </li>
<li> Theoretical foundations of Deep Learning and Reinforcement Learning </li>
<li> Statistical Learning Theory </li>
<li> Exploring extensions of Classical Learning to the Quantum Setting, including the use of quantum resources and designing algorithms for Quantum Learning</li>
</ul>

## Other Interests

If given a choice, I would go no further than playing cricket! I absolutely love everything about the sport! I also enjoy watching and analyzing cricket matches. 

Apart from that, I also enjoy playing table tennis, playing the guitar, indulging in public speaking activities and more!
