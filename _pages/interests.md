## Research Interests

I usually like to work at the intersection of theory and application, with an emphasis on the former. I am interested in the following areas:

<ul>
<li> Machine Learning and Optimization </li>
<li> Reinforcement Learning, Bandits, and Online Learning </li>
<li> Quantum Cryptology and Quantum Key Distribution </li>
<li> Quantum Algorithms and Circuits, equivalent representations, and their theoretical guarantees </li>
<li> Entangling (pun intended!) Quantum Science with AI and ML  </li>
</ul>

## Other Interests

If given a choice, I would go no further than playing cricket! I absolutely love playing cricket! I also enjoy watching and analyzing cricket matches. 

Apart from that, I also enjoy playing table tennis, playing the guitar, indulging in public speaking activities and more!
