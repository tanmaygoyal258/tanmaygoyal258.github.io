I have a genuine passion for teaching. I strongly believe that the only way to truly master a concept is to teach the ideas' breadth and depth to another person from scratch.

Fortunately, I have had the opportunity to be a teaching assistant and the head teaching assistant for several undergraduate and postgraduate courses at IIT Hyderabad. They are as follows:

## Head Teaching Assistant

<ul>

<li> <b>Programming with AI</b> (Spring '24) 
    <p> Course Instructor: <a href = "https://karthikpn.com"> Dr. P.N. Karthik </a> </p>
    <p>In addition to the duties of a TA, I was also allowed to give an entire lecture on Clustering and Backpropagation, apart from assisting in the creation of questions for the assignments. </p>
</li>

<li> <b>Deep Learning</b> (Spring '23) 
    <p> Course Instructor: <a href = "https://krmopuri.github.io"> Dr. Konda Reddy Mopuri </a> </p>
    <p>In addition to the duties of a TA, I was allowed to conduct a series of tutorials for the students on OOPs in Python and introducing them to the basics of PyTorch with all teaching material made from scratch. </p>
</li>

</ul>
